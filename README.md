#What is BarCamp?
BarCamp is an international network of user-generated conferences primarily focused around technology and the web. It is community driven, self-organizing, free, tech conference. Our first BarCamp in Baton Rouge is on its way!

#Who Can Come to BarCamp Baton Rouge?
Anyone can come to BarCamp Baton Rouge!

The speaker line-up is generated by attendees (including you, if you want) who have a topic, story, knowledge, or experience to share with the rest of the community. Because of BarCamp Baton Rouge's open and participatory nature, it is great for the expert and novice alike.

Have a topic you'd like to speak on? Know something about a new technology? Want to share your favorite ham sandwich recipe? BarCamp Baton Rouge is for you!

#When is this happening?
BarCamp Baton Rouge is currently in the planning stage and will happen later this year.
